# Route Planning Project
C++ Nanodegree Program

---
## Introduction
This is a self explanatory starter project of C++ nanodegree. The picture that is included in the project, explains the code architecture.

Steps to follow:
1. Once you successfully compile the code (after passing the test script included), to get rendered result you need to build the executable in virtual desktop's Visual studio.
2. Download completed workspace repo and upload it to your github.
3. Then in virtual desktop, log into your github and clone repo.
4. Build and run the code in Visual studio to see the rendered result on map.

  * This library must be built in a place where CMake `find_package` will be able to find it

## Compiling and Running

### Compiling
To compile the project, first, create a `build` directory and change to that directory:
```
mkdir build && cd build
```
From within the `build` directory, then run `cmake` and `make` as follows:
```
cmake ..
make
```
### Running
The executable will be placed in the `build` directory. From within `build`, you can run the project as follows:
```
./OSM_A_star_search
```
Or to specify a map file:
```
./OSM_A_star_search -f ../<your_osm_file.osm>
```

## Testing

The testing executable is also placed in the `build` directory. From within `build`, you can run the unit tests as follows:
```
./test
```
